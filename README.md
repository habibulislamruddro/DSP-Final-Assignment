DSP Final Assignment by Imran Sir ICE,PUST

lab 8.Design an FIR filter to meet the following specifications—Passsband edge=2KHz, Stopband edge= 5KHZ, Fs=20KHz, Filter length =21, use Hanning window in the design
lab 9. Creating a signals ‗s‘ with three sinusoidal components (at 5,15,30 Hz) and a time vector 't' of 100 samples with a sampling rate of 100 Hz, and displaying it in the time domain. Design
an IIR filter to suppress frequencies of 5 Hz and 30 Hz from given signal.
lab 10. Design a Lowpass filter to meet the following specifications—Passsband edge=1.5KHz,
Transition width = 0.5KHz, Fs=10KHz Filter length =67; use Blackman window in the
design.
lab 11. Design a bandpass filter of length M=32 with passband edge frequencies fp1=0.2 and fp2=0.35
and stopband edge frequencies fs1=.1 and fs2=0.425.
